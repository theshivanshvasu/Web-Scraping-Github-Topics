# Web-Scraping-Github-Topics
We're going to scrape the top repositories of top topics from the Github page.

## Libraries used in the project
1. requests ---> The requests module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python. The HTTP request returns a Response Object with all the response data (content, encoding, status, etc).
2. BeautifulSoup ---> Beautiful Soup is a Python library that is used for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files. It creates a parse tree from page source code that can be used to extract data in a hierarchical and more readable manner.
3. Pandas ---> Pandas is used for cleaning, transforming, manipulating and analyzing data and also converting dataframes into csv files.
